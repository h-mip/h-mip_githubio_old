# Activity Space Project

This is the website for the Activity Space Project. The project aims to better understand human mobility at the scale of cities. By studying daily patterns of movement across a city, we can learn about access to resource and exposure to hazards. We can learn about barriers that lead to inequality and opportunities to improve peoples' lives. This project requires participation: We are looking for volunteers to answer a short survey and to track their activity-spaces using an open source mobile phone application that is designed to protect privacy. Members of the research team will be walking all over Barcelona during the spring of 2018 looking for volunteers.
